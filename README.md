A day with ggplot2
===================

I chose ggplot2 because of its use of grammar of graphics and high level of flexiblity in plot specification.

Grammar of graphics
-------------------
The basic idea of grammar of graphics is independently specify plot building blocks and finally combine them to get the desired graphs and plots you want.
Building blocks include:
*data
*aesthetic mapping
*geometric object
*statistical transformations
*scales
*coordinate system
*position adjustments
*faceting
